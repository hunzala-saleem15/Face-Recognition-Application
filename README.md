# 👁️ Face Detection using OpenCV in Python

This project performs **real-time face detection** using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers.  
It also detects **eyes and smiles** within detected faces, displays the **number of faces** detected live, and supports toggling **face blur for privacy**.

## 🌟 Application & Use Cases

This face detection system can be used in various practical applications such as:

- **Security Systems:** Detect and monitor faces in surveillance footage to alert for unknown persons or intrusions.  
- **Access Control:** Use face detection as a first step in facial recognition systems to grant or restrict access.  
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Detect facial features for interactive applications like emotion analysis or augmented reality filters.  
- **Privacy Protection:** Blur faces in live video streams to anonymize individuals in public spaces or recordings.  
- **Attendance Monitoring:** Count faces in classrooms, offices, or events to track attendance automatically.  
- **Healthcare:** Monitor patient alertness or detect smiles as an indicator of mood or recovery progress.
